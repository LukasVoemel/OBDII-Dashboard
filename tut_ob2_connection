1. bluetoothctl

2. power on 

3. pairable on 

4. agent on 

5. default-agent

5. scan on

6. find the mac address and pair: 

7. pair B0:FD:E1:3F:5C:1F

8. we then have to bind addapter to serial port 

9. sudo rfcomm bind rfcomm0 B0:FD:E1:3F:5C:1F  

10. we then use screen to communicate with it 

11: minicom -D /dev/rfcomm0 

12: atz

13: athl 

14: atsp0 

15: to exit minicom you have to do ctr A -> z -> X 



-----------------------

modify the /etc/rc.local file to do things at bootup and startup 
I am writting a script which we will put into the local file to run at boot up


Another thing I did was create the file sudo nano /stc/systemd/system/rfcomm-bind.service

then I ran these 3 command : 
sudo systemctl daaemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable rfcomm-bind.service
sudo systemctl start rfcomm-bind.service 


systemd is a serivlce manaager for linux OS. which is used to manage system serices processes and other system tasks during startup and runtime 

sudo nano /etc/bluetooth/input.conf : this is where I added the timeout = 0
